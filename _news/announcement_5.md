Went to Iowa to present our paper Datapath Verification via Word-Level E-Graph Rewriting at [FMCAD 2023](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD23/)! A great conference with lots of interest in the work, many thanks to the organizers. Here's a photo of myself with the world's largest concrete gnome from the trip. [gnome](gnome.jpg)
