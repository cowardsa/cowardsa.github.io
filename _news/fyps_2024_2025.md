My two final year project students presented their final dissertations. [Iurii Zamiatin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/notiurii/?originalSubdomain=uk) did great work developing **e_graph_smt_bv**, an SMT solver for the bitvector theory based on the egglog equality saturation library. Then along a parallel thread [Luigi Rinaldi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-rinaldi/?originalSubdomain=uk) built **parabit** a tool for proving once and for all the correctness of parametric bitvector transformations.
