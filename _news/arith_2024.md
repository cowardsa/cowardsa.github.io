At ARITH this year both Theo Drane and I presented papers. I presented the final work of my PhD [Combining Power and Arithmetic Optimization via Datapath Rewriting](https://www.ac.uma.es/arith2024/papers/Combining%20Power%20and%20Arithmetic%20Optimization%20via%20Datapath%20Rewriting.pdf), whilst Theo presented our second paper [On the Systematic Creation of Faithfully Rounded Commutative Truncated Booth Multipliers](https://www.ac.uma.es/arith2024/papers/On%20the%20Systematic%20Creation%20of%20Faithfully%20Rounded%20Commutative%20Truncated%20Booth%20Multipliers.pdf)! This was my first in-person ARITH so was great to meet many people for the first time, I particularly enjoyed Andrew Fitzgibbon's keynote on ML number formats   .
