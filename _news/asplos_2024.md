Raf presented our paper [SEER: Super-Optimization Explorer for High-Level Synthesis using E-graph Rewriting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3620665.3640392) at [ASPLOS 2024](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2024/)! Had a great time working with Jianyi Cheng on this paper, where we combined e-graph rewriting and MLIR.
