Just back from 3 weeks in Cornell visiting [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/), [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) and [Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/), kicking off a couple of promising collaborations! Was lucky enough to give two talks. One on using redundant representations to build fast arithmetic circuits ([slides](/assets/pdf/Synthesizing_Fast_Arithmetic_Circuits_Cornell_Nov_2025.pdf)) and one on my PhD research applying equality saturation to circuit design ([slides](/assets/pdf/Equality_Saturation_Industrial_Circuit_Design_Cornell_Nov_2025.pdf)).
