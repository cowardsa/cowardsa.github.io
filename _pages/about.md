I am a Research Fellow in the [Programming Languages Group](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) at UCL working with [Prof. Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/). In 2025 I completed my PhD at Imperial College London in the Circuits and Systems Group, under the supervision of [Prof. George Constantinides](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/gac1/). During my PhD I spent four happy years working for the [Intel Graphics Numerical Hardware Group](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/open/graphics-numerical-hardware/overview.html), where I contributed to Intel's GPU designs.
My research looks at all aspects of numerical hardware design and how we can create fast but verified hardware. My [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/Thesis_Imperial.pdf) looked at using equality saturation to optimise RTL level circuit designs, with side projects investigating bitvector transformation correctness and tight arithmetic expression bounds.
